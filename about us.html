                        <p class="nn">  Tattooing is a peculiar way of self-expression of a person. For a tattoo artist, a tattoo is his work of art, the realization of his vision of an idea. Like the tattoo wearer, the artist wants to get an exceptionally flawless result. That is why live communication is so valued in our Studio. Before you sign up for a session or start developing a sketch, we invite you to a free consultation with a tattoo artist, where we have the opportunity to get acquainted and present your ideas. Through this direct interaction, the artist gets to know the person better, being able to understand his inner world, in order to offer his vision of the tattoo that will best reflect him. Thus, there is no need to search for a suitable drawing online or order a paid sketch. After you approve the concept proposed by the artist, the latter begins to develop an individual sketch of the tattoo.
                            <br> Our Studio has a team of three tattoo artists, each with their own unique style. The cost of a tattoo is discussed with the artist at a preliminary consultation. And remember, a tattoo is PAINFUL, EXPENSIVE and FOREVER!</p>
